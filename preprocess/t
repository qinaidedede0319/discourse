Skai TV is a Greek free - to - air television network based in Piraeus .
It is part of the Skai Group , one of the largest media groups in the country .
It was relaunched in its present form on 1st of April 2006 in the Athens metropolitan area , and gradually spread its coverage nationwide .
Besides digital terrestrial transmission , it is available on the subscription - based encrypted services of Nova and Cosmote TV .
Skai TV is also a member of Digea , a consortium of private television networks introducing digital terrestrial transmission in Greece .
At launch , Skai TV opted for dubbing all foreign language content into Greek , instead of using subtitles .
This is very uncommon in Greece for anything except documentaries ( using voiceover dubbing ) and children 's programmes ( using lip - synced dubbing ) , so after intense criticism the station switched to using subtitles for almost all foreign shows .
